# Django Portfolio Application

This project was created by following Part One of the Learn Django Basics Tutorial on Real Python. 

So far, this is just the basic portfolio app that shares only the projects on basic cards for the app user to view and add if they have Admin privileges.

I am continuing to build upon the basic foundation of this application.
